Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American 
countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the 
thousands who are suffering. Speaking during his general audience, 
the pope urged ``all public and private institutions and all men of 
good will'' to do all they can ``in this grave moment of destruction 
and death.'' Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout 
Central America in a disaster of such proportions that relief agencies 
have been overwhelmed. Among those attending the audience were six 
Russian cosmonauts taking a special course in Italy. As a gift, they 
gave John Paul a spacesuit.
