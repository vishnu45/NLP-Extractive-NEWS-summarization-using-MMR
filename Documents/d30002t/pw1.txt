Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch 
roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and 
intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground. 
President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert 
and the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from their 
homes on islands near the coast. At 0900 GMT Tuesday, Mitch was 95 
miles (152 kilometers) north of Honduras, near the Swan Islands. With 
winds near 180 mph (289 kph), and even higher gusts, it was a Category 
5 monster _ the highest, most dangerous rating for a storm. The 350-mile 
(560-kilometer) wide hurricane was moving west at 8 mph (12 kph). 
``Mitch is closing in,'' said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of Utila, 
an island 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the Honduran coast. ``And God 
help us.'' Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States, forecasters 
said, but was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for five 
days. The U.S. National Weather Service in Miami said Mitch could 
weaken somewhat, but warned it would still remain ``a very dangerous 
hurricane capable of causing catastrophic damage.'' The entire coast 
of Honduras was under a hurricane warning and up to 15 inches (38 
centimeters) of rain was forecast in mountain areas. The Honduran 
president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and 
ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from 
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's 
central coast. The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung 
Pacheco, said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the 
storm, but he warned the military could not reach everyone. ``For 
that humanitarian work, we would need more than 300 Hercules C-137 
planes,'' he said. ``Honduras doesn't have them.'' A hurricane warning 
was also in effect for the Caribbean coast of Guatemala. In Belize, 
a hurricane watch was in place and the government also closed schools 
and sent workers home early Monday. Panic buying stripped bread from 
the shelves of some stores and some gasoline stations ran dry. Coastal 
Belize City was hit so hard by Hurricane Hattie in 1961 that the country 
built a new capital inland at Belmopan. Mexico mobilized troops and 
emergency workers Monday on the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula, 
which was also under a hurricane watch, and Cuba said it had evacuated 
600 vacationers from the Island of Youth. Jerry Jarrell, the weather 
center director, said Mitch was the strongest hurricane to strike 
the Caribbean since 1988, when Gilbert killed more than 300 people. 
In La Ceiba, on Honduras' northern coast, people stood in long lines 
at filling stations Monday to buy gasoline under a steady rain. Maria 
Gonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with when her firewood gets 
wet. Still, she bought only 37 cents worth _ all she could afford. 
``I have six children, and we live in a riverbed,'' she said. ``If 
it gets really bad, we'll go to the church and see what the architect 
of the world has in store for us.'' Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman 
on Utila, had tied up his boats and was taking his family to stay 
with a relative on higher ground. National police spokesman Ivan Mejia 
said the Coco, Segovia and Cruta rivers all overflowed their banks 
Monday along Honduras' eastern coast. ``Frightened people are moving 
into the mountains to search for shelter,'' he said. In El Progreso, 
100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, 
the army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana 
plantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident. 
Before bearing down on Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and the 
Cayman Islands. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican capital, 
Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in the Caymans, 
a British colony of 28,000 people. The strongest hurricane to hit 
Honduras in recent memory was Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' 
Caribbean coast, killing at least 2,000 people.
