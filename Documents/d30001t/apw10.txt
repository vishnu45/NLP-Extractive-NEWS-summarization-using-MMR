King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen. In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
``The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly 
bring peace and progress to our nation and people,'' Sihanouk wrote. 
Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC 
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government 
at a summit convened by Sihanouk. The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly. Sihanouk, recalling 
procedures used in a past government, suggested Tuesday that he should 
appoint the first two members of the upper house. The remaining senators, 
he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government 
and the National Assembly. Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly. Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties.
