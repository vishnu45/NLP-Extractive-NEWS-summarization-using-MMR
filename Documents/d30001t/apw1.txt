Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties' demands 
for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to ``internationalize'' 
the political crisis. Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed. Opposition leaders Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition 
figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not 
negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence 
in Beijing. Hun Sen, however, rejected that. ``I would like to make 
it clear that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted 
in the Kingdom of Cambodia,'' Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet 
meeting on Friday. ``No-one should internationalize Cambodian affairs. 
It is detrimental to the sovereignty of Cambodia,'' he said. Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that 
Hun Sen's victory in the elections was achieved through widespread 
fraud. They have demanded a thorough investigation into their election 
complaints as a precondition for their cooperation in getting the 
national assembly moving and a new government formed. Hun Sen said 
on Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country 
was ``just an excuse for them to stay abroad.'' Both Ranariddh and 
Sam Rainsy have been outside the country since parliament was ceremonially 
opened on Sep. 24. Sam Rainsy and a number of opposition figures have 
been under court investigation for a grenade attack on Hun Sen's Phnom 
Penh residence on Sep. 7. Hun Sen was not home at the time of the 
attack, which was followed by a police crackdown on demonstrators 
contesting Hun Sen's election victory. The Sam Rainsy Party, in a 
statement released Friday, accused Hun Sen of being ``unwilling to 
make any compromise'' on negotiations to break the deadlock. ``A meeting 
outside Cambodia, as suggested by the opposition, could place all 
parties on more equal footing,'' said the statement. ``But the ruling 
party refuses to negotiate unless it is able to threaten its negotiating 
partners with arrest or worse.''
