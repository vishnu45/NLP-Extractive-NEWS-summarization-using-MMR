Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country. The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life. Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament 
from his party have been holed up overseas for two months. But a deal 
reached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 
on forming a new government last week has opened the door for their 
return. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians. His assurances come a week before the first session 
of Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly. Sam Rainsy said 
Wednesday that he was unsatisfied with the guarantee. He said it contained 
indirect language and loopholes that suggest he and his Sam Rainsy 
Party members are still under threat of arrest from Hun Sen's ruling 
party. ``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement. ``But instead they make 
roundabout statements, full of loopholes that can easily be exploited 
by a legal system that is completely in their control.'' Ranariddh 
told reporters Wednesday that he believed it was safe for Sam Rainsy 
in Cambodia. Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government. Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly. The deal assures 
the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. 
The men served as co-prime ministers until Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh 
in a coup last year. ``I think Hun Sen has got everything. He's got 
the premiership and legitimacy through the election and recognition 
from his majesty the king. I don't think there is any benefit for 
Hun Sen to cause instability for our country,'' Ranariddh said. The 
prince also said that his top general, Nhek Bunchhay, would not be 
given back his previous position as the second-ranking general in 
the Cambodian military's general staff. Nhek Bunchhay's outnumbered 
forces in the capital put up tough but unsuccessful resistance to 
last year's coup.
